\chapter{Preface}

This is document is a part of my Master of Science graduation thesis. The idea of doing my thesis on this subject came after my scholarship committee, The Ministry of Communication and Information of the Republic of Indonesia required me to do research on the communication field. I remembered, Prof. dr. ir. Michel Verhaegen once presented some projects of his current research, and one of them is the project of control of airplane communication. I, later, contacted him asked about this project, and he then introduced me to my thesis supervisor, Dr. Sander Wahls whose expertise in communication.

The most important technical acknowledgment is made to Dr. Sander Wahls, for providing me with guidance and opportunities for learning telecommunication, a field which I am interested to yet not experienced in. I would also like to thank Laurens Bliek for his constant support and willingness to discuss the problems I have encountered in this project.

Moreover, I would like to thank all my friends with whom I traveled, shared incredible memories, laughter and joy. Finally, I would like to deeply thank my family who have supported me in all my endeavours and motivated me to aim higher.
