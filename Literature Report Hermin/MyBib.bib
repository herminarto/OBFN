        abstract = {The Telecommunication Engineering group at the University of Twente is currently working on two projects about phased array antenna systems with photonic beam-formers. One is the SMart Antenna systems for Radio Transceivers (SMART) project. The other is the Broadband Photonic Beamformer project.
Some of the advantages of implementing the beam forming network in the optical domain are immunity to electromagnetic interference, high bandwidth and low loss.
The optical delays needed for the beamforming are realized with Optical Ring Resonators (ORRs), which can be tuned by varying their parameters. To get higher delay values multiple rings are cascaded and the rings should be tuned in such a way that the delay ripple is minimal in the frequency band of interest.
The goal of the assignment was to design a subsystem which converts a desired set of delay values into a set of optimal ORR parameters. The _rst step to do this was to derive optimality criteria. Three di_erent criteria were the result of this: the delay criterion, phase criterion and power criterion. All of them used a metric value which was the sum of the squared deviation from the target at a certain number of points.
Three tuning algorithms followed from those criteria by optimizing for the criteria using Non Linear Programming (NLP) techniques. The phase tuning algorithm was concluded to be best suited to use for the derivation of rules of thumb. This was because negative side e_ects of improper tuning like the rise of side lobes in the radiation pattern are directly dependent on the phase error and the power tuning algorithm gave only slightly better results at the cost of a signi_cant increase in complexity.
Since these algorithms were too complex to implement directly into a microcon-troller, rules of thumb were needed. One option was a lookup table, which had severe memory requirements since the 2 kB for a 1_4 OBFN was approaching the limits of the current system. The other option was to store only coe_cients of curve-_tted polyno-mials, which saves a lot of memory at the cost of a little processing time and accuracy.
The research also gave solutions for adapting the algorithms when a di_erent ORR response formula is found or when the system needs to be expanded to a 1_M OBFN.
Another result from the research was the delay tuning range covered by a certain number of rings. From that the conclusion was drawn that only three rings were needed in the _rst stage of a 1_8 OBFN instead of four.
