Title           : Tuning of Optical Beamforming Networks

In an aircraft-satellite communications, aircrafts transmit highly focused beams that are steered exactly towards satellites. Conventional solutions for this problem is to steer dish antennas mechanically in order to direct the beam. Optical Beamforming Networks (OBFNs) instead, rely on many small and flat antennas that are coordinated in order to generate highly focused beams. In this project, a new type of OBFN proposed by Meijerink et al. in 2010 will be considered. The correct tuning of these OBFNs such that the beam is steered correctly is a difficult nonlinear problem that so far has only be addressed with off-the-shelf solvers in very small setups.

The problem of tuning a large-scale OBFN is very similar to training a neural network. For the later problem, many recent advances have been made under the umbrella term deep learning. The goal of this project is to explore if and how advances in deep learning can be exploited to train OBFNs. This can be achieved either by formulating the tuning problem as a learning problem, or by modifying existing algorithms in the area of deep learning. The tuning methodology developed by the student should be based on feedback that can be measured in real systems (e.g., output power)
